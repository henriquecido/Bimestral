## About


I created a web page for a fictional company, which I named "RH Vitória". It consists of 5 pages, being home, student, company, vacancies and the candidate's area.

I made your logo through the Wix Logo Maker platform, and many images inside the application I removed from the internet. RH Vitória is responsive for Web and Mobile, and can be easily viewed at the link below.

Until now,

I haven't created the user login / registration yet.
Because the company is fictitious, it does not have social networks, so its anchor tags do not lead anywhere.
On the vacancies page I created a very simple filter and the vacancies are not many, I plan to optimize them briefly.
